Unfortunately, little was known at the time about the mammalian visual cortex that could inform Rosenblatt's work. Consequently, the photo-perceptron architecture was inspired by a very coarse idea of how the information flows from the retina to be processed by the brain. This changed fast in the years following the introduction of the perceptron. \n",

This is what they did: they placed tiny microelectrode in a single neuron in the primary visual cortex (V1) of an anesthetized cat and projected light and dark dots into the cat's eye. It did not work at all, they could not get a response from the neuron. But, they had a lucky accident. Since they were using a slide projector to show the dots, the *margin of the slide* with the dot also was projected into the cat's eyes and bam! the neuron fired. From there, they experimented with light and dark bars in different orientations, which led them to propose the existence of **two types of cells in the visual cortex**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **simple cells**, that fire at a higher (or lower) rate depending on the bar orientation. Sometimes called \"line detectors\".\n",
    "2. **complex cells** that fire in response to a wider variety of orientations, yet, they still show a preference (higher firing rate) to certain orientations. Sometimes are called \"motion detectors\". Importantly, these cells receive input from several *simple cells*. \n",

Then, each cell in a $S_1$ patch \"reads\" a sub-section of the input image based on a \"preference\" for a certain type of pattern. Any given layer $L_n$ will have several of these $S_j$ patches as a collection of **feature \"filters\"**. Some may detect a diagonal line, while other a small triangle, or a corner, or something else. Each $S_j$ patch connects to a $C_k$ cell, and such a cell fires if it gets any positive input from its corresponding patch. This process is also known as **\"pooling\"**. This cycle of \"feature\" detection and \"pooling\" is repeated as many times as intermediate layers in the network. The last layer corresponds to the output, where some neurons will fire depending on the input pattern. Mathematically, \"feature detection\" is accomplished by multiplying the input by a fixed matrix of weights, whereas \"pooling\" corresponding to taking an average of the connected patch of S-cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the behavior of the S-cells and C-cells replicate (to some extent) what Hubel and Wiesel found in their experiments. The great thing about this architecture is that it is **robust to shifts in the input image**: you can move the image around and the combination of \"feature detection\" and \"pooling\" will detect the presence of each part of the image regardless of its position. **Figure 2** exemplifies this characteristic."

At the time, backpropagation was not widely known as a training method for multilayer neural networks, reason why Fukushima never use it. Instead, he trained his model by using an unsupervised learning approach. Regardless, the Neocognitron laid the groundwork of modern neural network models of vision and computer vision more generally."

    "The architecture today known as the convolutional neural network was introduced by [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/) in 1989. Although LeCun was trained as an Electrical Engineer, he got interested in the idea of building intelligent machines from early on in his undergraduate education by reading a book about the [Piaget vs Chomsky debate on language acquisition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010027794900345). In that book, several researchers argued in favor of or against each author's view. Among those contributors was [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) who mentioned Rosenblatt's perceptron in his article, which inspired LeCun to learn about neural networks for the first time. Ironically, this was the same Seymour Papert that published [the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book)) (along with Marvin Minsky) that brought the demise on the interest on neural networks in the late '60s. I don't believe in karma, but this certainly looks like it. \n",

The next layer $L-1$ is composed of several **features maps**, which have the same role that the Neocognitron simple-cells: to extract simple features as oriented edges, corners, end-points, etc. In practice, a feature map is a squared matrix of **identical weights**.  Weights *within* a feature map need to be identical so they can detect *the same* local feature in the input image. Weights *between* feature maps are different so they can detect *different* local features. Each unit in a feature map has a **receptive field**. This is, a small $n \\times n$ sub-area or \"neighborhood\" of the input image that can be \"perceived\" by a unit in the feature map.  \n",

Also, imagine that you have a set of images that were drawn with invisible ink. Now, you need your special flashlights to reveal the hidden character in the image. What you need to do is to carefully illuminate each section of the invisible image, from *right to left and top to bottom*, with each of your 6 flashlights. Once you finish the process, you should be able to put together all the little \"features\" revealed by each flashlight to compose the full image shape. Here, the square beam of light sliding over each pixel represents the aforementioned *receptive field*, and each flashlight represents a *feature map*. \n",

For instance, if we know that we have a \"curvy horizontal line\" at the center-bottom, a \"curvy vertical line\" at the middle-right, a \"straight vertical line\" at upper-left, and a \"straight horizontal line\" at the center-top, we should be able to tell we have a \"5\". This is even more important considering that real-life images like handwritten numbers have considerable variability in their shape. No two individuals write numbers in the exact same manner. Hence, we want our network to be as *insensitive as possible* to the absolute position of a feature, and as *sensitive as possible* to its relative position: handwritten 5s may look different, but the curvy part is almost always at the bottom and the straight part at the top. This is sometimes referred to as **invariance to local translation**. One way to accomplish this is by **reducing the spatial resolution of the image**. This is what **sub-sampling** or **pooling** does. \n",

This time, there is no overlap between each \"stride\" of the receptive field: each unit is connected to a *non-overlapping section* of the original feature map. You can think about this as taking \"strides\" of a size equal to $n$, e.g., for a $3 \\times 3$ feature map, we take a stride of $3$. Then, we take a weighted average of each pixel in the receptive field and pass the resulting sum through a sigmoid function (or any other non-linear function). The *weights* in the weighted average are also parameters that the network learns with training. **Figure 6** shows this process for a *single* sub-sampled feature map."

For instance, the LeNet 5 paper (1998) was published in the context of the debate between traditional pattern recognition with handcrafted features vs the automated learning-based approach of neural nets. Nothing was said about human perception. However, from our perspective, the issue of **whether convolutional nets are a useful model of human perception and vision** is critical. This is an open debate.

    "\n",
    "Regarding the first question, technically, we could \"flatten\" the image into a long vector *from the beginning*, and then use a traditional multi-layer perceptron to classify the images. Just imagine aligning each pixel $[p_{00}, p_{01}, ..., p_{ji}]$ one after the other in a long list, such that each pixel becomes a feature. This is way simpler than bothering with convolution or cross-correlation. The short answer is: because the **topological information matters**. Flattening the image lose such topological information. In other words, the relative position of each pixel in the grid matters, and we want to **exploit such space-dependence** when learning the network weights. If you train a model to recognize faces, the relative distance between *your eyes* and your *mouth* matters. Knowing that the images have a pair of eyes and a mouth is not enough. Therefore, we want to keep such a grid-structure when training the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the second question, the answer is: **no, it does not matter**. Well, it does matter in terms of the implementation, computational complexity, etc. But it does not matter in terms of finding a solution. The training algorithm will **ensure that the appropriate weights are learned** regardless. In short, when you use *convolution* the network will learn a matrix of weights $W$. If you use *cross-correlation* instead, the network will learn a set of weights $-W$, i.e., the weights \"flipped\"."

    "Before implementing LeNet-5 and AlexNet I want to introduce an issue I have ignored so far: model **generalization**. If you are familiar with these issues feel free to skip to the next section. I've intentionally ignored these issues to fully focus on understanding the ideas behind the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, a neural network is an equation, a function. A very complicated one but it's just that: a bunch of functions wrapping each other with some number of adjustable parameters (the weights). The assumption of any machine learning model is that there is an equation \"out there\" describing the relationship between **features** and **outputs**, more or less in the same fashion that $e=mc^2$ describes the relationship between *energy* (i.e., *the output*) as a function of mass (i.e., *feature 1*) and the speed of light squared (i.e., *feature 2*). And, that such equation can be *learned* or *approximated* by using a combination of an architecture and a training algorithm. Once you learn/approximate the equation, you can feed feature values (like mass and speed of light) to the network and make very precise predictions about the output (energy), like in physics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the issue with machine learning is that problems most people are interested to solve, like image recognition or language understanding, are so complex that no simple formula can be (or has been) found. Otherwise, we would not bother at all with machine learning. Therefore, we *flipped the problem*: we build systems that learn (approximate) the solution (function) for us by means of **extracting patterns from exemplars**. For instance, in face recognition, there is no known equation describing the relationship between the pixels in a face-image and subject identity. So we try to learn one. The problem with this strategy is that our models are **constrained to the information contained in the data**. Let's say you train a \"children vs adults\" classifier. In an ideal world, you would want to take a large random sample of the entire human species to train your model, so your model can extract \"patterns\" (i.e., statistical information) present in all human sub-groups. In practice, you can't do that. What you can do is to take freely available face-images from the internet. It is easy to see the problem with such a strategy: face-images on the internet are **highly biased**. For instance, the internet contains way more photos of white people from developed countries than from, let's say, Aboriginal Australians. The same goes for gender, age, and any other variation imaginable: the data is biased. If you train your model to perfection with that kind of dataset, your model may be very good at classifying pictures from the former group, but not from the latter. Another way to say this is that your model **does not generalize well to out-of-sample exemplars**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning practitioners are fully aware of this problem. The traditional strategy to address it is to split the sample into two groups: **training** and **testing**. The training sample is used to train the model and learn the mathematical function relating features to targets. The testing sample is used *only* to test the model and obtain a measure of **generalization**. When the training and testing accuracy are really close, we say the model predictions generalize well. Otherwise, we say the model is **overfitting** the data. This is, the learned equation \"fits\" the data so well, that now is unable to make good predictions for out-of-sample exemplars. We also have the opposite phenomena: **underfitting**. A model is underfitted when it is so simple that has poor accuracy in the training set, and mediocre to poor in the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is usually approached with a mix of techniques in neural networks: data augmentation, dropout, weight decay, early stopping, and others. Overfitting is often interpreted as a sign of excessive **model complexity**, so all these techniques try to simplify the model. Underfitting is usually approached with more training, more complex architectures, or more data. The goal is the opposite, to get increase model complexity so it can fit the data. In practice, the goal is to obtain a **balanced** model: neither overfitted nor underfitted, just \"good-enough\" fitted.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 13** summarizes underfitting and overfitting in the two dimensional case. A extended treatment of issue for neural networks can be found [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/regularization.html), [here](https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/underfit-overfit.html), and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10686.pdf)."

We can only hope that our sample data is a good enough representation of the real-world data. **No amount of regularization, cross-validation, etc. will fix poorly sampled data**."

It may take days to train, and I'm not even sure it would fit in memory.

I'll base LeNet-5 implementation on the generic CovNet [example provided by the official Keras documentation](https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/). Implementing LeNet-5 in its original form requires a lot of custom code, particularly because the RBD activation function and the MAP cost function are hardly used anymore, hence they are not part of the standard set of functions in modern deep learning libraries. Therefore, I'll use the softmax activation and cross-entropy loss as replacements. The goal here is dual: to modify a standard CovNet implementation to match it *as closely as possible* to the original LeNet-5, and to provide explanations at each step of the implementation. "

    "Which such a large number of parameters training our model to a meaningful accuracy level in a typical CPU may take from hours to days. For instance, my [Intel i7-8550U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/122589/intel-core-i7-8550u-processor-8m-cache-up-to-4-00-ghz.html) takes around 14 minutes to run 1 epoch. Running 50 epochs would take around 12 hours. There are several alternatives to train large models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Locally**: if you have a computer with one or multiple [state-of-the-art GPUs](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/choosing-a-gpu-for-deep-learning/), you could use that and the training of our model should be pretty fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High throughput computing (HTC)**: if you have access to a grid of computers (and know how to use it), you could take our code, repackage it, and use that. Most major universities have HTC or HPC clusters available for students. HTC computing is ideal for training neural networks since trained can be parallelized in multiple cores, significantly speeding up training time. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remotely (cloud)**: you can use either someone else server via an SSH connection or cloud services as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Google Colab**: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a remote interactive computing environment (basically a Jupyter Notebook in a google computer) typically used to train machine learning models. It grants you free access to 1 GPU with a time limit (12 or 24 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transfer learning**: recall that training a network essentially is to learn weight values. If someone else trained AlexNet in CIFAR-10, such a person can save the weights learned by the network, and we could re-use them for our porpuses. For popular models and datasets, most deep learning libraries provide pre-trained models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a demo like ours, Google Colab is the best option. I copy-pasted AlexNet into a Colab notebook that you can [access here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CJhNrMVEKLOTlq-eYwAENZjlJbGdGe4o#forceEdit=true&sandboxMode=true). I also saved the model such that we can reuse the trained parameters to make predictions in our test set. If you wanna go through the process of training AlexNet yourself, you can use the Colab Notebook and run the cells (in \"Playground mode\"). When I trained AlexNet with CIFAR-10 each epoch took a bit more than 1 minute to run, so training the model for 50 epochs should take about 1 hour. \n",

    "We obtain **~55% of test accuracy** which is significantly below the training accuracy. This is an example of **overfitting** or **overtraining**. There are multiple ways to address overfitting which I won't cover here (more normalization, dropout, early stopping, etc). It may be also the case we need a **different architecture** or simply **more training time**. More training is a counterintuitive suggestion: \"How is that more training would help if \"too much training\" was causing the problem in the first place?\" Turns out that sometimes neural networks shown a phenomenon known as [\"double descent\"](https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/): performance improves, then get worse, and then *improves again*. if you want to learn more about double descent see [here](https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/). \n",

Change a couple of pixels here and there to the picture of a \"panda\", and the network will predict \"gibbon\" with embarrassingly high confidence. From a cognitive science perspective, this is admittedly concerning, since such alterations are barely noticeable for humans, as illustrated by Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy (2015) in **Figure 14**."

    "- They are a consequence of the [high-dimensional of the input-space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02774)\n",
    "- They are a consequence of the [finite-sample phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07690)\n",

    "The first five explanations are a problem for the idea that convolutional networks are a good conceptual model of human perception. They all indicate that something important is missing in our models that deviate from human perceptual processes, challenging their utility. Some point out to this kind of problem to suggest that there is something [so fundamentally different between human and neural nets perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631) that we should either abandon or significantly changed neural nets to be useful models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last explanation challenges the first five. It is proposing that there is nothing wrong with neural networks. In brief, the idea is that what human perceives as \"meaningless noise\", in fact, is a relatively robust pattern which is useful to learn to make predictions. In other words, networks \"see\" things humans are missing, which are *features* as useful as \"tails\" and \"legs\" for prediction *in the training dataset*. True, this does not fully address the differences between machine and human perception, but it does contradict the idea neural networks are paying attention to useless features: they do pay attention to useful features, as humans do."

    "Limitations aside, convolutional networks are among the best examples of connecting cognitive neuroscience with artificial neural networks. Convolutional nets **core design principle** comes from classic neuroscience research: hierarchically organized layers of simple cells and complex cells acting together to build complex representations of objects. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of convolutional nets regarding human cognition, is they are by far the most successful model in terms of emulating human **performance** (emphasis in performance, not processes) in perceptual task. Further, the interplay between human vision and perception and neural nets is an active area of research that is trying to address the many limitations of this approach. "
