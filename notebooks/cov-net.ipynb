Unfortunetaly, little was known at the time about the mammalian visual cortex that could inform Rosenblatt's work. Consequently, the photo-perceptron architecture was inspired by a very coarse idea of how the information flows from the eyeballs to be processed by the brain. This changed fast in the years following the introduction of the perceptron. \n",

This is what they did: they placed tiny microelectrode in a single neuron in the primary visual cortex (V1) of an anesthetized cat, and proyected light and dark dots into the cat's eye. It did not work at all, they could not get a response from the neuron. But, they had a lucky accident. Since they were using a slide projector to show the dots, the *margin of the slide* with the dot also was projected into the cat's ayes and bam! the neuron fired. From there, they experimented with light and dark bars in different orientations, which led them to propose the existence of **three types of cells in the visual cortex**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **simple cells**, that fire at higher (or lower) rate depending on the bar orientation. Sometimes called \"line detectors\".\n",
    "2. **complex cells** that fire in response to a wider variety of orientations, yet, they still show a preference (higher firing rate) to certain orientations. Sometimes are called \"motion detectors\". Importantly, these cells receive input from several *simple cells*. \n",

Then, each cell in a $S_1$ patch \"reads\" a sub-section of the input image based on a \"preference\" for certain type of pattern. Any given layer $L_n$ will have several of this $S_j$ patches as a collection of **feature \"filters\"**. Some may detect a diagonal line, while other a small triangle, or a corner, or something else. Each $S_j$ patch connects to a $C_k$ cell, and such a cell fires if gets any positive input from its corresponding patch. This process is also known as **\"pooling\"**. This cycle of \"feature\" detection and \"pooling\" is repeated as many times as intermediate layers in the network. The last layer correspond to the output, where some neuron will fire depending of the input pattern. Mathematically, \"feature detection\" is accomplished by multiplying the input by a fix matrix of weights, whereas \"pooling\" corresponding to taking an average of the connected patch of S-cells. \n",

    "You may have noticed that the behavior of the S-cells and C-cells replicate (to some extent) what Hubel and Wiesel found in their experiments. The great thing about this architecture is that is **robust to shifts in the input image**: you can move the image around and the combination of \"feature detection\" and \"pooling\" will detect the precense of each part of the image regardless of its position. **Figure X** exemplifies this characteristic."

At the time, backpropagation was not widely known as a training method for multilayer neural networks, reason why Fukushima never use it.

In that book, several researchers argued in favor or against each authors view. Among those contributors was [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) who mentioned Rosenblatt's perceptron in his article, which inspired LeCun to learn about neural networks for the first time.

The next layer $L-1$ is composed of several **feature maps**, which have the same role that the Neocognitron simple-cells: to extract simple features as oriented edges, corners, end-points, etc. In practice, a feature map is a squared matrix of **identical weights**.  Weights *within* a feature map pattern need to be identical so they can detect *the same* local feature in the input image. Weights *between* feature maps patterns are different so they can detect *different* local features. Each unit in a feature map has a **receptive field**. This is, a small $n \\times n$ sub-area of the input image that can be \"perceived\" by a unit in the feature map at any given time.  \n",

Also imagine that you have a set of images that were drawn witn invisible ink. Now, you need your special flashlights to reveal the hidden character in the image. What you need to do is to carefully iluminate each section of the invisible image, from *right to left and top to bottom*, with each of your 6 flashlights. Once you finish the process, you should be able to put together all the little \"features\" revealed by each flashlight to compose the full image shape.

For instance, if we know that we have a \"curvy horizontal line\" at the center-bottom, a \"curvy vertical line\" at the middle-right, a \"stright vertical line\" at upper-left, and a \"stright horizontal line\" at the center-top, we should be able to tell we have a \"5\".

Hence, we want our network to be as *insensitive as possible* to the absolute position of a feature, and as *sensitive as possible* to its relative position.

You can think on this as taking \"strides\" of a size equal to $n$, e.g., for a $3 \\times 3$ feature map, we take a stride of $3$. Then, we take weighted average of each pixel in the receptive field, and pass the resulting sum through a sigmoid function (or any other non-linear function).

For instance, the LeNet 5 paper (1998) was published in the context of the debate between traditional pattern recognition with handcrafted features vs the automated learning-based approach of neural nets. Nothing was said about human perception. However, from our perspective, the issue of **whether convolutional nets are useful model of human perception and vision** is critical. This is a open debate.

    "\n",
    "Regarding the first question, technically, we could \"flatten\" the image into a long vector *from the beginning*, and then use a traditional multi-layer perceptron to classify the images. Just imagine aligning each pixel $[p_{00}, p_{01}, ..., p_{ji}]$ one after the other in a long list, such that each pixel becomes a feature. This is way simpler than bothering with convolution or cross-correlation. The short answer is: because the **topological information matters**. In other words, the relative position of each pixel in the grid matters, and we want to **exploit such space-dependence** when learning the network weights. If you train a model to recognize faces, the relative distance between *your eyes* and your *mouth* matters. Knowing that the images has a pair of eyes and a mouth is not enough. Therefore, we want to keep the grid-structure when training the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the second question, the answer is: **no, it does not matter**. Well, it does matter in terms of the implementation, computational complexity, etc. But it does not matter in terms of finding a solution. The training algorithm will **ensure that the appropiate weights are learn** regardless. In short, when you use *convolution* the network will learn a matrix of weights $W$. If you use *cross-correlation* instead, the network will learn a set of weights $-W$, i.e., the weights \"flipped\"."

It also requires relatively advance knowledge of Python just to read the code, which is not assummed here.\n",

    "Fortunately, modern deep learning libraries make relatively easy to build convolutional networks. As in the previous chapter, I'll implement LeNet-5 and AlexNet using [Keras](https://keras.io/). For LeNet-5 we will use the MNIST dataset. Unfortunately, the ImageNet dataset dataset is too large (e 1.2 million high-resolution images) to utilize in a free-to-use CPU cloud environment. It may take days to train to a decent accuracy level, and I'm not even sure it would fit in memory. As a replacement we will use the [CIFAR-10 small image dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to test AlexNet."

    "There are more tutorials about MNIST image classification with Keras in the internet that I can count. Yet very few implement LeNet-5, most assume you know Keras already, and many have bugs. I'll base LeNet-5 implementation on the [example provided by the official Keras documentation](https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/). Implementing LeNet-5 in its original form requires a lot of custom code, particularly because the RBD activation function and the MAP cost function are hardly used anymore, hence are not part of the standard set of functions in modern deep learning libraries. Therefore, I'll use the softmax activation and cross-entropy loss as replacements. In sum, my goal here is dual: to modify an standard CovNet implementation to match it *as closely as possible* to the original LeNet-5, and to provide explanations at each step of the implementation.
