    "The ADALINE (*Adaptive Linear Neuron*) was introduced in 1959, shortly after Rosenblatt’s perceptron, by *Bernard Widrow* and *Ted Hoff* (one of the inventors of the microprocessor) at Stanford. Widrow and Hoff were electrical engineers, yet Widrow had attended the famous [Dartmouth workshop on artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop) in 1956, an experience that got him interested in the idea of building brain-like artificial learning systems. When Widrow moved from MIT to Stanford, a colleague asked him whether he would be interested in taking Ted Hoff as his doctoral student. Widrow and Hoff came up with the ADALINE idea on a Friday during their first session working together. At the time, implementing an algorithm in a mainframe computer was slow and expensive, so they decided to build a small electronic device capable of being trained by the ADALINE algorithm to learn to classify patterns of inputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the perceptron and the ADALINE is that the later works by minimizing the [*mean squared error*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) of the predictions of a linear function. This means that the learning procedure is based on the outcome of a *linear function* rather than on the outcome of a threshold function as in the perceptron. **Figure 2** summarizes such difference schematically. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a cognitive science perspective, the main contribution of the ADALINE was methodological rather than theoretical. Widrow and Hoff were not primarily concerned with understanding the organization and function of the human mind. Although the ADALINE was initially applied to problems like speech and pattern recognition (Talbert et al., 1963), the main application of the ADALINE was in adaptive filtering and adaptive signal processing. Technologies like adaptive antennas, adaptive noise canceling, and adaptive equalization in high-speed modems (which makes Wifi works well), were developed by using the ADALINE (Widrow & Lehr, 1990).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, learning from the output of a linear function enables the minimization of a continuous [*cost or loss function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function). In simple terms, a cost function is a measure of the overall *badness* (or *goodness*) of the network predictions. Continuous cost functions have the advantage of having \"nice\" derivatives, that facilitate training neural nets by using the [chain rule of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule). This change opened the door to train more complex algorithms like non-linear multilayer perceptrons, logistic regression, support vector machines, and others. \n",

    "At this point, you may be wondering what's the difference between the perceptron and the ADALINE considering that both end up using a threshold function to make classifications. The difference is the **learning procedure to update the weight** of the network. The perceptron updates the weights by computing the difference between the expected and predicted *class values*. In other words, the perceptron always compares +1 or -1 (predicted values) to +1 or -1 (expected values). An important consequence of this is that perceptron *only learns when errors are made*. In contrast, the ADALINE computes the difference between the expected class value $y$ (+1 or -1), and the *continuous* output value $\\hat{y}$ from the linear function, which can be *any real number*. This is crucial because it means the ADALINE can learn *even when no classification mistake has been made*. This is a consequence of the fact that predicted class values $\\hat{y}'$ do not influence the error computation. Since the ADALINE learns *all the time* and the perceptron only after errors, the ADALINE will find a solution faster than the perceptron for the same problem. **Figure 1** illustrate this difference in the paths and formulas highlighted in red."

Since the weights are the *only values* we can adjust to change the shape of the line, **different pairs of weights will generate different means of squared errors**. This is our gateway to the idea of finding a *minima* in an error surface. Imagine the following: you are trying to find the set of weights, $w_1$ and $w_2$ that would generate the smallest mean of squared error. Your weights can take values ranging from 0 to 1, and your error can go from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100% thinking proportionally).

    "The results now look like a  mess. The middle pane shows how the MSE error explodes almost immediately. The right pane is there just to show how absurd is the difference between the two $\\eta$ values. \n",

    "The network went from solving the problem in 12 iterations to an MSE of 4822,208,321,414 in the 5th iteration, and to a prediction accuracy equivalent to random guessing. Actually, if you try increasing the learning rate even more, the MSE would be so large it would \"overflow\" or exceed the capacity of your computer to represent integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very strange. What is going on? In simple terms, the step-size is so large that after the first iteration, the error is so far-off from the minima of the function, that it can't find its way in the right direction after that. Instead, the error starts to spiral out of control until it blows up and your computer runs out of memory. Remember, the ADALINE computes the $\\hat{y}$ by multiplying each feature by the weights. Consider a bird with $x_1 = 10,000$ and $x_2 = 300$. Let's compute the predicted value for that case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "error = (1 - 103.01)^2 = 10,406\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a huge number. With enough data, the network should learn to reduce the $w_i$ until are small enough to make sensible predictions. But, if you start with predictions that are too far-off, the network may become unable to get back on track. **Figure 7** succinctly illustrate this idea. "

    "With the ADALINE, Widrow and Hoff introduced for the first time the application of learning via gradient descent in the context of neural network models. If you are familiar with the contemporary literature in neural networks, you may be thinking I'm wrong or even lying. \"Everybody knows that Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams were the first ones on doing this in 1985\". What Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams introduced, was a generalization of the gradient descend method, the so-called \"backpropagation\" algorithm, in the context of training multi-layer neural networks with non-linear processing units. Hence, it wasn't actually the first gradient descent strategy ever applied, just the more general. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in practice how training a neural network with the Widrow and Hoff approach dramatically reduced the training time compared to the perceptron learning procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the ADALINE had a great impact in areas like telecommunications and engineering, its influence in the cognitive science community was very limited. Nonetheless, the methodological innovation introduced by Widrow and Hoff meant a step forward in what today we know is standard algorithms to train neural networks. "
